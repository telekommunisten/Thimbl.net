            Here’s how:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Sign up for Drumbeat!</h3>
                    <p>
                    <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/user/register">https://www.drumbeat.org/user/register</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why? Well not only is drumbeat the host platform for 
                        the open web award, but even though it’s fairly new 
                        platform, it has the Mozilla foundation behind it and 
                        could well become an important hub for projects that 
                        create the web open, and the sooner you sign up, 
                        the more likely your favourite username is still 
                        available! So Sign up! In any case you need to sign up
                         and be logged in to vote for Thimbl!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Vote for Thimbl</h3>

                        This is optional, but the Transmediale Jury is quite 
                        interested in what you like about the project, and so are we!
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Now, sit back and feel good about helping us in the battle 
                against the centralization and enclosure of the internet! The 
                Open Web Award would mean a lot for us, since it helps promote 
                the ideas behind Thimbl and to attract enough participants to 
                make it a viable platform. But, if you’re inspired to get even 
                more involved, come say hi in our new <a href="http://www.thimbl.net/community.html">community forum</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks! Pass it on, if you could.
            </p>

				<h1>But I really wanna!</h1>
				<p>
				    OK, OK! If you really want to start playing with Thimbl, you'll
				    need to install Finger  on you server
				    (<a href="get_finger.html">which is pretty easy, see how here</a>)
				    and have your own domain. Got that? Right. Now you can start using thimbl
				    (as long as you have a .plan file structured correctly.)
				</p>
				<p>
				    You don't really want to be using Finger manually, or creating
				    your own .plan files, which is handy, 
				    as one of our contributors, Mark Carter, has put together
				    a CLI client (that's a command line client for those who aren't nerds!).

				Thimbl is a set of client-side tools for a distributed open source
                microblogging platform. Thimbl-CLI is a set of command-line tools, and
                is more modest in its ambitions than the whole of the Thimbl project. - Mark Carter

                <h2>Using Thimbl CLI</h2>
                <p>
                Thimbl-CLI requires Linux/cygwin. It also includes the simplest
                possible finger daemon to serve your messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get the CLI client here by <a href="http://alt-mcarter.blogspot.com/2010/11/command-line-tool-for-thimbl.html">
                    visiting Marks Blog</a> or grabbing the files from <a href="https://github.com/blippy/Thimbl-CLI">Github</a>.
                <p>
                Thimbl-CLI is pretty much ready to go out of the box client-side.
